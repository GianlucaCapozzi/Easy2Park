# Easy2Park

## Description:
This is an Android app DEMO project based on Sensoro™ Beacons (https://www.sensoro.com) and Azure Iot Hub (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/). The idea is to make it easier to find free parking lots. This is done through bluetooth connectivity to Sensoro beacons and Azure cloud computing.
